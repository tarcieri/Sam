Sam: A Ruby Package Manager
===========================

Sam provides unobtrusive management for Ruby gems

Goals
-----

* Be fast
* Be *really* fast
* Minimize the runtime component as much as possible
* Stay mostly compatible with the existing RubyGems ecosystem
* Combine package management and dependency resolution into a single tool
* Depend only on the Ruby standard library

Usage
-----

A usage section sure is important! I hope one gets written soon.

Why?
----

A lot of people aren't happy with how RubyGems works today. This has lead to
a slew of alternative Ruby package managers like SlimGems, rip, rup, and jerk.
While these are all noble attempts, none of them provide automatic dependency
management. Sam attempts to provide similar functionality to RubyGems and
Bundler in a single, simple-as-possible package.
